COLIEE-2022 Workshop Task 1 and 2

This repository describes our submission to the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment 2022 (COLIEE-2022) workshop on case law competition for tasks 1 and 2. 
* Task 1 is a legal case retrieval task, which involves reading a new case and extracting supporting cases from the provided case law corpus to support the decision. 
* Task 2 is the legal case entailment task, which involves the identification of a paragraph from existing cases that entails the decision in a relevant case. 
* We employed the neural models Sentence-BERT and Sent2Vec for semantic understanding and the traditional retrieval model BM25 for exact matching in both tasks.
